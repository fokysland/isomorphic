# :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: Isomorphic
## App that runs in a browser, on a server, android and ios

It is isomorphic thanks to [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) technology, which allows you to run the same code in web and native. Also, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is used here, so the same code gets rendered firstly at the server, then on the client

Repositories are located at `/packages` dir, each package has its own README.md
